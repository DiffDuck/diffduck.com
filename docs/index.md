# Quickstart

**diffduck** is an AI-powered writing assistant for git commit messages.

Before you start, make sure that you have the **diffduck** CLI tool installed.

We support [macOS](/docs/install), [Windows](/docs/install), and [Linux](/docs/install).

**1. Setup your git repository.**

```bash title="Run the following in your git repository"
$ diffduck up
```

**2. Iterate.**

```bash title="Run the following in your git repository"
$ vim main.py
## Make some edits, then hit save.
$ git add main.py
$ git commit 
```

**3. Draft a good commit message by answering diffduck's questions.**

TODO: Add a screen capture of the **diffduck** workflow.
